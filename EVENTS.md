# Custom Events provided by SandboxPlus

- "game.init": run on initial addon load
- "sandbox.hud.loaded": run after the Sandbox.Hud has loaded, eg. for extending the spawnmenu
- "entity.spawned"
  - `Event.Run( "entity.spawned", IEntity spawned, IEntity owner )`
- "undo.add"
  - `Event.Run( "undo.add", Func<string> undo, IEntity owner )`
  - Add an "Undoable" lambda, which will be called if the player wants to undo.  
    Should return the string to show in the toast, or empty string if the undoable is redundant and should be skipped over (eg. if the weld was already removed)
- "spawnlists.initialize"
  - Takes no parameters; you're expected to call `ModelSelector.AddToSpawnlist( "screen", string[] models)`
- "player.simulate"
  - `Event.Run( "player.simulate", SandboxPlayer player )`
- "player.killed"
  - `void OnKilled( SandboxPlayer player )`
- "trace.prepare": used to modify Player movement traces
  - ```
    [Event( "trace.prepare" )]
    public static void OnTracePrepare( Trace trace, Entity ent, Action<Trace> returnFn ) {
        returnFn(trace.WithoutTags( StargateTags.InBufferFront ) );
    }
    ```
- "weapon.shootbullet": used to allow overriding bullet behaviour, such as when shooting through a Stargate
  - Takes a single ShootBulletParams parameter. Writing `params.preventDefault = true` will disable the default bullet behaviour.
